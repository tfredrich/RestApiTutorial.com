REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs have revolutionized the way developers build and integrate web services, enabling seamless communication between systems and applications.

{{% notice tip "Generative AI, Agentic AI, and APIs" %}}
APIs are the backbone of generative AI (GenAI), enabling large language models (LLMs) and AI agents to securely access real-world business data, systems, and operations through tools, integrations, and standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

As GenAI systems move beyond simple chat into autonomous agents that reason, act, and execute workflows, the quality of your APIs becomes a critical competitive advantage. Well-designed APIs make data accessible, reliable, and performant for AI consumption, while robust authentication, authorization, and governance ensure sensitive information remains protected.

In the future of AI-driven applications, secure, scalable, and well-constructed (and documented) APIs are not optional; they are the foundation that allows GenAI to deliver real business value without compromising safety or trust.
