        <summary>1xx Informational</summary>
        <div>
            <p>This class of status code indicates a provisional response, consisting only of the Status-Line and optional headers, and is terminated by an empty line. There are no required headers for this class of status code. Since `HTTP/1.0` did not define any `1xx` status codes, servers MUST NOT send a `1xx` response to an `HTTP/1.0` client except under experimental conditions.</p>
            <p>A client MUST be prepared to accept one or more <code>1xx</code> status responses prior to a regular response, even if the client does not expect a <code>100 (Continue)</code> status message. Unexpected <code>1xx</code> status responses MAY be ignored by a user agent.</p>
            <p>Proxies MUST forward <code>1xx</code> responses, unless the connection between the proxy and its client has been closed, or unless the proxy itself requested the generation of the <code>1xx</code> response. (For example, if a proxy adds a <code>Expect: 100-continue</code> field when it forwards a request, then it need not forward the corresponding <code>100 (Continue)</code> response(s).)</p>

            <summary>100 Continue</summary>
            <div>
                <p>The client SHOULD continue with its request. This interim response is used to inform the client that the initial part of the request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The client SHOULD continue by sending the remainder of the request or, if the request has already been completed, ignore this response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed. See [section 8.2.3] for detailed discussion of the use and handling of this status code.</p>
                <h3>Wikipedia</h3>
                <p>This means that the server has received the request headers, and that the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a <code>POST</code> request).
                    If the request body is large, sending it to a server when a request has already been rejected based upon inappropriate headers is inefficient. To have a server check if the request could be accepted based on the request's
                    headers alone, a client must send <code>Expect: 100-continue</code> as a header in its initial request and check if a <code>100 Continue</code> status code is received in response before continuing (or receive
                    <code>417 Expectation Failed</code> and not continue).</p>

            <summary>101 Switching Protocols</summary>
            <div>
                <p>The server understands and is willing to comply with the client's request, via the Upgrade message header field (section 14.42), for a change in the application protocol being used on this connection. The server will switch protocols to those defined by the response's Upgrade header field immediately after the empty line which terminates the `101` response.</p>
                <p>The protocol SHOULD be switched only when it is advantageous to do so. For example, switching to a newer version of <code>HTTP</code> is advantageous over older versions, and switching to a real-time, synchronous protocol might be advantageous when delivering resources that use such features.</p>
                <h3>Wikipedia</h3>
                <p>This means the requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server is acknowledging that it will do so.</p>

            <summary>102 Processing (WebDAV)</summary>
            <div>
            <p>The `102 (Processing)` status code is an interim response used to inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request, but has not yet completed it. This status code SHOULD only be sent when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will take significant time to complete. As guidance, if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a `102 (Processing)` response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed.</p>
                <p>Methods can potentially take a long period of time to process, especially methods that support the Depth header. In such cases the client may time-out the connection while waiting for a response. To prevent this the server may return a `102 (Processing)` status code to indicate to the client that the server is still processing the method.</p>
                <h3>Wikipedia</h3>
                <p>As a `WebDAV` request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, it may take a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet. This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.</p>

                <p>The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created. The newly created resource can be referenced by the URI(s) returned in the entity of the response, with the most specific URI for the resource given by a Location header field. The response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of resource characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by the media type given in the Content-Type header field. The origin server MUST create the resource before returning the 201 status code. If the action cannot be carried out immediately, the server SHOULD respond with 202 (Accepted) response instead.</p>
                <p>A 201 response MAY contain an ETag response header field indicating the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant just created, see section 14.19.</p>

The request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place. There is no facility for re-sending a status code from an asynchronous operation such as this.</p>
                <p>The 202 response is intentionally non-committal. Its purpose is to allow a server to accept a request for some other process (perhaps a batch-oriented process that is only run once per day) without requiring that the user agent’s connection to the server persist until the process is completed. The entity returned with this response SHOULD include an indication of the request’s current status and either a pointer to a status monitor or some estimate of when the user can expect the request to be fulfilled.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client. The range header is used by tools like wget to enable resuming of interrupted downloads, or split a download into multiple simultaneous streams. The request MUST have included a Range header field (section 14.35) indicating the desired range, and MAY have included an If-Range header field (section 14.27) to make the request conditional.</p>
                <p>The response MUST include the following header fields:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Date</li>
                    <li>Either a Content-Range header field (section 14.16) indicating the range included with this response, or a multipart/byteranges Content-Type including Content-Range fields for each part. If a Content-Length header field is present in the response, its value MUST match the actual number of OCTETs transmitted in the message-body.</li>
                    <li>ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent in a 200 response to the same request.</li>
                    <li>Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might differ from that sent in any previous response for the same variant.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the 206 response is the result of an If-Range request that used a strong cache validator (see section 13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers. If the response is the result of an If-Range request that used a weak validator, the response MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers. Otherwise, the response MUST include all of the entity-headers that would have been returned with a 200 (OK) response to the same request.</p>
                <p>A cache MUST NOT combine a 206 response with other previously cached content if the ETag or Last-Modified headers do not match exactly, see 13.5.4.</p>

The actual current instance might not be available except by combining this response with other previous or future responses, as appropriate for the specific instance-manipulation(s).  If so, the headers of the resulting instance are the result of combining the headers from the status-226 response and the other instances, following the rules in section 13.5.3 of the HTTP/1.1 specification.</p>
                <p>The request MUST have included an A-IM header field listing at least one instance-manipulation.  The response MUST include an Etag header field giving the entity tag of the current instance.</p>
                <p>A response received with a status code of 226 MAY be stored by a cache and used in reply to a subsequent request, subject to the HTTP expiration mechanism and any Cache-Control headers, and to the requirements in section 10.6.</p>
                <p>A response received with a status code of 226 MAY be used by a cache, in conjunction with a cache entry for the base instance, to create a cache entry for the current instance.</p>

The status codes 303 and 307 have been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which kind of reaction is expected of the client.</blockquote>
                <h3>Wikipedia</h3>
                <p>This is an example of industry practice contradicting the standard.[2] The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily"), but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours. However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.</p>

            <div>
                <p>If the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is allowed, but the document has not been modified, the server SHOULD respond with this status code. The 304 response MUST NOT contain a message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.</p>
                <p>The response MUST include the following header fields:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Date, unless its omission is required by section 14.18.1</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a clockless origin server obeys these rules, and proxies and clients add their own Date to any response received without one (as already specified by [RFC 2068], section 14.19), caches will operate correctly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent in a 200 response to the same request</li>
                    <li>Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might differ from that sent in any previous response for the same variant</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the conditional GET used a strong cache validator (see section 13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers. Otherwise (i.e., the conditional GET used a weak validator), the response MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers.</p>
                <p>If a 304 response indicates an entity not currently cached, then the cache MUST disregard the response and repeat the request without the conditional.</p>
                <p>If a cache uses a received 304 response to update a cache entry, the cache MUST update the entry to reflect any new field values given in the response.</p>

                <p>Indicates the resource has not been modified since last requested. Typically, the HTTP client provides a header like the If-Modified-Since header to provide a time against which to compare. Using this saves bandwidth and reprocessing on both the server and client, as only the header data must be sent and received in comparison to the entirety of the page being re-processed by the server, then sent again using more bandwidth of the server and client.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection MAY be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. This response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.</p>
                <p>The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s) , since many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 307 status. Therefore, the note SHOULD contain the information necessary for a user to repeat the original request on the new URI.</p>
                <p>If the 307 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued.</p>
                <h3>Wikipedia</h3>
                <p>In this case, the request should be repeated with another URI; however, future requests can still use the original URI. In contrast to 302, the request method should not be changed when reissuing the original request. For instance, a POST request must be repeated using another POST request.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The 511 status code indicates that the client needs to authenticate to gain network access.</p>
                <p>The response representation SHOULD contain a link to a resource that allows the user to submit credentials (e.g. with a HTML form).</p>
                <p>Note that the 511 response SHOULD NOT contain a challenge or the login interface itself, because browsers would show the login interface as being associated with the originally requested URL, which may cause confusion.</p>
                <p>The 511 status SHOULD NOT be generated by origin servers; it is intended for use by intercepting proxies that are interposed as a means of controlling access to the network.</p>
                <p>Responses with the 511 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.</p>
                <p>The 511 status code is designed to mitigate problems caused by &quot;captive portals&quot; to software (especially non-browser agents) that is expecting a response from the server that a request was made to, not the intervening network infrastructure.  It is not intended to encouraged deployment of captive portals, only to limit the damage caused by them.</p>
                <p>A network operator wishing to require some authentication, acceptance of terms or other user interaction before granting access usually does so by identifing clients who have not done so (&quot;unknown clients&quot;) using their MAC addresses.</p>
                <p>Unknown clients then have all traffic blocked, except for that on TCP port 80, which is sent to a HTTP server (the &quot;login server&quot;) dedicated to &quot;logging in&quot; unknown clients, and of course traffic to the login server itself.</p>
                <p>In common use, a response carrying the 511 status code will not come from the origin server indicated in the request's URL.  This presents many security issues; e.g., an attacking intermediary may be inserting cookies into the original domain's name space, may be observing cookies or HTTP authentication credentials sent from the user agent, and so on.</p>
                <p>However, these risks are not unique to the 511 status code; in other words, a captive portal that is not using this status code introduces the same issues.</p>
                <p>Also, note that captive portals using this status code on an SSL or TLS connection (commonly, port 443) will generate a certificate error on the client.</p>
